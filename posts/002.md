### Update:

As planned earlier, I integrated tailwind css to my [personal website](https://github.com/akshaypatil26/nextjs-blog). The process was pretty straightforward.

I also spent time on reverting a commit which I had made on the go, just to continue the streak I had maintained since January 1st. Eventually, I felt I was cheating myself doing that. So I took a break from pushing to github for the weekend, thereby ending the streak.

### Next up:

I am looking to follow along [React 18 tutorial video](https://youtu.be/2-crBg6wpp0) uploaded by freeCodeCamp. I am hoping to learn a few important concepts in React and also a few from plain Javascript.
