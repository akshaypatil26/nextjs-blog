### About this website:

On January 1st, 2023, I decided to get better and fluent in coding. For that to happen the only way I could think of was to be regular with writing code. About 3 months before that, I had started to learn German on Duolingo app. There is a feature on the app which tracks your daily streak. Unintentionally, to maintain the streak, I started to learn a little bit of German daily. Even if it was for 5 mins, I got into a habit where I cannot pass a day without learning German on the app. I decided to do the same with programming. 

After half a decade of finishing my Masters degree, I now have a vision for myself. I am going to work towards UX design and have a deep knowledge about the tools used to build user interfaces and full stack applications. [ReactJS](https://beta.reactjs.org/) is a tool I am familiar with, and certainly it is one of the skills in demand. So why not continue with it? I will be tracking my progress with daily commits to [my github profile](https://github.com/akshaypatil26).

This website/blog is a log of all of the things I do to better myself at coding (and UX design). Every week, I'll update my progress with a blog post over here. This basic example of a blog is from the Next.js documentation. I plan to make changes to this overtime as and when I learn new ways of maintaining a blog.

### Week 1-4: Update for January 2023

For the month of January I worked on making a basic structure of a website. I started with html, css on my personal website on [this github repository](https://github.com/akshaypatil26/akshaypatil26.github.io). Further, I decided to add Next.js to it.

For the rest and most of January I followed the documentation covering [basics of ReactJS and Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs). This website is the product of the documentation covering the same. All the code can be found on [this repository on github](https://github.com/akshaypatil26/nextjs-blog).

Along with the basics of Next.js, I got to learn [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which I have found to be useful and interesting.
